User Controls:

The left and right arrow keys move the falling piece left or right. The 'a' key rotates the piece. The down arrow key makes the piece fall faster.

Future updates will include:

1)Expected drop position 2)Upcoming pieces window 3)Score 4)Login/ High-score 5)Prototype inheritance for game pieces. 6)Better rotation algorithms

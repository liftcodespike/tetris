I always thought it would be fun to make tetris, so I decided today that I would give it a try.
The game uses Javascipt, and HTML, and a little jQuery on top.


User Controls:

  The left and right arrow keys move the falling piece left or right.
  The 'a' key rotates the piece.
  The down arrow key makes the piece fall faster.
  
Future updates will include:

  Expected drop position
  Upcoming pieces window
  Score
  Login/ highscore
  Prototype inheritance for game pieces.
  Better rotation alogoritms

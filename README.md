I always thought it would be fun to make tetris, so I decided today that I would give it a try.
The game uses Javascipt, and HTML, and a little jQuery on top.


User Controls:

  The left and right arrow keys move the falling piece left or right.
  The 'a' key rotates the piece.
  The down arrow key makes the piece fall faster.
